# E-Commerce Transactions Data Analysis

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and business insights
- Develop a Lookalike model/ recommendation system.
This model  takes a user's information as input and recommends 3 similar
customers based on their profile and transaction history. The model uses both customer and product information. Then assigns a similarity score to each recommended customer.

- Then Clustering is performed using K-means clustering. The clustering analysis yielded 3 clusters, with a Davies-Bouldin Index of 0.6929, which suggests a reasonably well-separated clustering structure. The Silhouette Score of 0.4637 indicates that the clusters are moderately distinct.
